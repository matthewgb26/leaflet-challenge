# Earthquake Data Visualization with Leaflet

This web application uses the Leaflet library to visualize earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake API. It displays data points on a map, where data points scale with magnitude levels and change colors with depth levels. Each data point has a tooltip showing the magnitude, location, and depth of the earthquake.

## Features

- Interactive map displaying earthquake data.
- Data points scaled based on magnitude.
- Data points colored based on depth.
- Tooltips providing information about each earthquake (magnitude, location, depth).
- A legend that explains the depth color-coding.
